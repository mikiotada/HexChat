Project Introduction
====================================
This is the web app that allows people to form a group of 6 (could be different) people together based on their similarities, such as common friends, location, background. The group will last for 7 days (or less) and people can selectively exchange contacts after the period ends. The app will have features for icebreaking and prompt lines for chatting. The goal is to encourage new connections in online and efficient ways.

The idea is motivated by the observation that many people who move to new, modern cities find it hard to make new friends. Existing social networks like Facebook mostly focus on maintaining current relationships, and there are plenty of dating apps out there to find your partner. But not many products focus on creating new friendships in an efficient and scalable way. Imagine if you currently relocate to a new city, how do you build your network other than work?

Our goal of this project is to solve this problem, connect people to who they should/could know!
